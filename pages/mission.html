                at cachevector, we're building the future one function at a time.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                not with buzzwords or bondwagons, but with actual math, machine learning, and code that ships. we're obsessed with pushing the boundaries of what's possible - whether that's crafting new ai libraries, exploring math research that most people scroll past, or building tools that make devs go "finally."
            </p>
            
            <p>
                we believe real innovation doesn't come from million-dollar marketing decks. it comes from open-source repos, sleepless nights, and a refusal to settle for "good enough." cachevector is where deep learning meets deep thinking - and then gets turned into something useful, fast.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                we don't just tinker. we publish, package, and push to prod. from lightweight utils to heavy-duty research, if it's solving a real problem, we're in. and if it helps devs, researchers, or the next generation of builders do more with less friction - that's exactly our kind of project.
            </p>

                follow the work. star the ideas. we're not trying to be loud - we're trying to be useful.
